Salary Prediction Model using Multiple Linear Regression
This repository contains code for a multiple linear regression model built to predict salaries for the HR team. 
The model utilizes data provided by the HR department to predict salaries based on various features such as years of experience, test score and interview score.

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that assists the HR team in estimating salaries for new hires or existing employees based on their qualifications and other relevant factors. 
By utilizing multiple linear regression, we aim to create a model that accurately predicts salaries while considering various features.

Usage
To use the salary prediction model:

Data Preparation: Prepare your data in a format compatible with the model. Ensure that the features used for prediction are consistent with those used during model training.
Model Training: Train the model using the provided training data. You can adjust the model parameters or features used for training as needed.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using validation or test data to assess its accuracy and reliability.
Salary Prediction: Utilize the trained model to predict salaries for new data instances or employees. Provide the necessary input features, and the model will generate salary predictions accordingly
